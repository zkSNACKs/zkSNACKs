PRIVACY POLICY
=========================================

This policy describes the ways zkSNACKs collects, stores, uses and protects personal information. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that zkSNACKs complies with applicable European Union (EU) and other statutory data protection laws and regulations, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection.
Data protection laws are generally relevant in case any processing of personal data is concerned. The terms used within the scope of this data protection declaration are defined in and by the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. As such, the wide definition of "processing" of personal data means any operation or set of operations performed on personal data.

Personally Identifiable Information
===================================

"Personally identifiable information" ("personal information") is any information that can be directly associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person's name.

Handling Information
====================

Since we are working on privacy, our mission is to regain personal privacy, our Services are designed to be used without indication of any personal data. For this reason we do not have any kind of data collecting solutions built into our products. There may only be one personal data processing in our Service, for customer support in case of technical problems: visitors may, indicate their email addresses voluntarily to get notifications in case of any potential technical problems or other enquiries. These e-mail addresses are solely used to answer users' questions and are erased after 100 days. In this case, the processing of the data is based on a freely given consent to Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR and is aimed at the effective handling of the complaint.
As the main platform for users' technical questions and issues we use Reddit to answer all questions, and we do not retain any data that can be subsequently identified / associated with the user.
We expressly declare that we do not manage or store any other personally identifiable information.

By visiting the Website and using our Services, You agree with this policy, in accordance with Section 1.2 of the Terms and Conditions
